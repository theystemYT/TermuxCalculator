Then, once your done with those steps, let's install Termux. If you already have it, just skip this part. If you don't, watch the video below, then go into your app store on your device and follow the steps in the video. (Note: This is the Google Play Store, which is only avaliable on Android devices, like chromebooks, which is what this script is intended for, so try your best, if you are on iPhone.)
