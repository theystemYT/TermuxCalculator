# Tutorial
Welcome to the Tutorial! Let's begin on how to execute this script, and get it working, as well with showing that it works!

Let's start with copying the script. Watch the video below, then leave this Tutorial, and go view the READ.me to follow the steps on the video.

Then, once your done with those steps, let's install Termux. If you already have it, just skip this part. If you don't, watch the video below, then go into your app store on your device and follow the steps in the video. (Note: This is the Google Play Store, which is only avaliable on Android devices, like chromebooks, which is what this script is intended for, so try your best, if you are on iPhone.)

Then, once your done with that, you want to launch Termux, and if it asks for permission for notifications, then allow it. (more info is in the READ.me on why you should, it is NEEDED for this script) Then, paste in the copied code. (it is in your clipboard, since you did copy it to your clipboard) Then press ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0f869b4-b31a-4334-b0a1-0510e89e9725), or Enter, or whichever key in your keyboard/digital keyboard acts as Enter, to execute the code, and your done! This video will also show usage of the calculator. Here is a video doing exactly that (This also shows that the script works as I did a test with the add keyword):
